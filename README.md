The Big Science Quiz

This project is a quiz, the idea is based on Big Web Quiz by Google.
It is going to be a quiz for the participants of the ESSS (European Schools Science Symposium). They shall answer questions in teams and we'll see who gets the most points. As per Big Web Quiz, we will display live statistics of answer popularity on a projected screen.

All teams will be given Android tablets with the bsq app installed, which they will use to get and answer questions. So one part of this project is the android app and the other is the server. Both are written in Java.
